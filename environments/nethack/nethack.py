        n_examples: dataset size for training rollouts / evaluation.
        seed: RNG seed for which (tier, episode-seed) pairs get sampled.
        max_turns: per-rollout turn cap (LM turns, not in-game turns).
        interface: "skill" (default — one tool per skill, OpenAI function-calling)
            or "code" (a single `code` tool that runs sandboxed Python against
            an `nh` namespace; the Track B / RLM-research path).

            glyph-run encoding, inventory diff). Default True; set False for raw v0.0.15
            rendering (replay/debugging).
        history_keep_full: number of most-recent turns kept at full fidelity in the

        history_drop_after: turns older than this distance are dropped behind a
            single elision marker.
        belief_state_interval: every N turns, SubLM.summarize is invoked and the
            result added to the journal as belief_state:tN. Set to 0 to disable.
        journal_render_max_chars: soft cap on per-turn journal block size; older
            non-belief-state notes get elided when over the cap.
        variant: obs/skill-structure variant for wave-1 experiments.
            "B1" (default) = current shipping behavior, no override.
            "P" = Continual Harness adaptation (arXiv:2605.09998): every
            `refine_interval` turns, inject a self-refinement directive
            asking the agent to revise its pinned objective and/or record
            a lesson note. Journal ops short-circuit the NLE step, so
            refinement is free game-turn-wise.
        refine_interval: cadence for variant=P self-refinement turns
            (default 20). Set to 0 to disable even when variant="P".
        summarize_and_reset: variant=R toggle. When True, get_prompt_messages
            drops every chat turn older than the most recent belief_state
            checkpoint. Pair with belief_state_interval > 0.
        trace_dir: if set, env_response writes per-turn NDJSON capturing
            raw_grid, structured_obs, rendered_user_message, assistant_message,
            tool_calls, action, reward, dlvl, hp. One file per rollout under
            <trace_dir>/<run_id>.ndjson. Off by default.
        continual: when True, the env auto-resets the underlying NLE on death
            and continues the same chat session, preserving journal + belief
            state. Implements the continual-harness mode (separate from
            variant=P's mid-rollout refinement).
        continual_lives: cap on auto-resets within a single rollout
            (default 5). Ignored unless continual=True.
        refine: when True, attach the full Continual-Harness teacher Refiner
            machinery (periodic teacher-LLM edits to the agent's prompt /
            sub-agents / skill-macros / journal, plus the run_macro tool) onto
