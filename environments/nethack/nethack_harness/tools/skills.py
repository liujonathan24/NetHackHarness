"""
nethack_harness.tools.skills
===================

NetPlay-style skill mode. Each skill is a callable that takes the current
NetHackCoreEnv and arguments, and returns a sequence of primitive NLE actions
plus a feedback message.

We use a registry pattern so the verifiers wrapper can introspect available
skills to auto-generate OpenAI tool schemas. This is the layer Alex's pysc2
analogy points at: the skill set is the agent's API to the world.

The full skill catalog is intentionally small in v0. Add to it as you
characterize what LLM agents actually need. Don't blindly mirror autoascend.
